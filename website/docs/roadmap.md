## 🧭 Long-Term Vision

**AskMyDocs** aims to evolve from a Q&A tool into a **knowledge intelligence platform** — enabling semantic retrieval, contextual summarization, and organizational insight.

- Enterprise-grade document intelligence  
- Self-hostable knowledge systems  
- Multi-model AI backends (OpenAI, Claude, Mistral)  
- Observability dashboards
